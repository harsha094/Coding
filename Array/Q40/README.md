Problem Statement

You have an array, of size N, which initially has all values equal to 0. In one operation, you can pick any subarray of this array, and increase all the values within the subarray by 1. You are also given a target array of size N. Determine the minimum number of operations, you will need, in order to transform your array into the target array. It can be proved, that the answer always exists.

Input Format – 

The first line shall contain a single integer N, denoting the number of values of the target array.
﻿Then, N lines will follow, denoting the values of the target array.
Constraints – 

1 <= N <= 10,0000
1 <= Array Values <= 10,000
Output Format – 

Print a single line, containing a single integer, the answer to the problem

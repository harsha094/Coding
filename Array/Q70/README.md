# You are given an array F of focal lengths of size f, F[0], F[1],...F[f-1]. You are asked to determine the indices of the elements from the biggest element to the smallest element.


Input Description:
The first line contains an integer f. The next line contains f space separated integers F[i], (0 <= i <= f-1) Note: The elements of F[i] are pairwise distinct.

Output Description:
Print f space separated integers, denoting the indices of the elements, from biggest element to smallest.

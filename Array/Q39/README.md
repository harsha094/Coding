A String Motor is a device that takes a string S and a value K from the user as input and returns a string as an output. The output string is the string obtained by rotating the input string by k characters in the backward direction.
For example, if the input string is "doselect" and k is 2, then the output string would be "selectdo".
Input Format
The first line contains a string S.
The second line contains an integer K.
Constraints
1 <= S.size() <= 105
0 <= K < S.size()
Output Format
Output must contain a single string.

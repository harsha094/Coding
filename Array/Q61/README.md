# String Encode and Decode
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement encode and decode

Constraints:

0 <= strs.length < 100
0 <= strs[i].length < 200
strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.
